Your client messages you the following:

Hi there! We need a bus schedule website. This website should contain the bus times for the F9S66 bus stop for the entire week.
We need the user's to be able to hop on the website, check bus times, and possibly send us some feedback in case busses are late. 
If they decide to send us some feedback, we need a way to contact them so please ensure that they put their name and email as well
as any other information you see fit. We need this done by the end of the hour. Please make it look as pretty as possible.
We understand the time frame isn't that long so having a functional website is much more important than a pretty website. Thanks!

HTML Criteria:
    1. Must have a table with bus times for the week
    2. Include the bus stop name at the top of the table
    3. Have an H1 tag at the top of the website that says "Bus times for stop F9S66"
    4. Beneath your table, there should be a p tag explaining that if the user were to experience delays, to please submit the below form 
    5. Have a form that has a submit button and requests the following information: Name, Age, email, phone number, time, and feedback

CSS Criteria:
    1. All content should be centered horizontally on your page
    2. Your table should have a border with rounded edges
    3. Your entire website should have a padding on all sides
    4. Your form should have a rounded border and be a square shape

Bonus:
    Bonus points if you can add more than what's described in the requirements and still meet the client's deadline

Tip: Always look to build something functional first. Once it's functional, then make it look pretty. Your client also cares more about functionality than looks, 
     so keep that in mind when working on their website.
